#overview of light units

Light units must be lit to function; they are blinded in the dark.

There are three light units: the Torch, the Prism, and the Wisp. The names of the units are still being sorted out.

### Torch ###
The torch is the light player's main unit. It produces all light. It is big and slow, but it cannot be blinded. The spread and direction of light can be controlled. We will also explore controlling light flow volume.

### Prism ###
The Prism is a medium-sized light unit. It takes light and redirects it. Light travels in the direction the unit is facing, and is refracted according to the unit's spread.

### Wisp ###
The Wisp (or Will o' the Wisp) is the light player's grunt unit. It is a small spirit that exists as an extension of the Torch. It is the only light unit that can [manipulate](Manipulation.md).
