#System that manages light particles

Light particles do not interact with one another however they will collide with the environment and the units

Most light behavior will be handled by the physics engine

Light particles are generated by light source

Light particles exit the game when they leave the map, otherwise they just bounce around

Units are either lit or unlit but they also have a value that shows how lit they are.

Light unit that are lit can be controlled and the degree doesn't matter

Dark units can handle being lit to a certain degree before being blinded

Smaller dark units have a smaller threshold and the larger units have a larger threshold


### Light Thresholds ###
**Sprite**
  * 0-30: Blind
  * 30-180 Lit
  * >180, no change (max)

**Prism**
Note: the prism loses light 10x as fast as normal units when light is over 90.
  * 0: Blind
  * 1-1500:Lit
  * 90-1500: Will act as light source
  * >1500, no change (max)

**LS**
  * Never blind
**Shade**
  * 0-60: Dark
  * 60-180: Blind
  * >180, no change, (max)

**Eye**
Note: the Eye loses light ~2x as fast as other units
  * 0-150: Dark
  * 170-180: Blind
  * >180, no change, (max) //Note: max might be higher for the Eye
