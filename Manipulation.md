#Pushing and pulling of blinded units

Manipulation is a central mechanic in this game. It is the pushing and pulling of other units.

All units can be manipulated when [blind](Blinding.md), though the [light](Light_Player.md) Light Source cannot be blinded.

Only two units can manipulate: Sprites and Shades. These units can manipulate any blind unit, friendly or not.

When a Sprite is selected, the player can order it to manipulate a blinded unit by clicking on the unit.

When a Sprite is manipulating a unit, the player can order it to release a blinded unit by clicking on the unit again.


Manipulation overhaul:
We need to make manipulation easier and more visually obvious.
