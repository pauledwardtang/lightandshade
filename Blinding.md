#Disabling units with light

Blinding occurs when either a light unit is not lit, or a dark unit is lit. It is a central mechanic, crucial for the victory of each player. It is also a major thematic element that we can play with.

A blind unit can not move, but can be [manipulated](Manipulation.md) by other units.

Blinded units can be selected but they don't execute orders. However it is possible to issue new orders to a blinded unit

When a unit goes blind it will remember the last orders and will execute it if unblinded

This includes move orders setting an angle and setting an direction. The new angle or the direction or new position will show up on the UI, but the unit will not change it states until it is unblinded
