#overview of dark units

Dark units are blinded by light. The dark player starts with ~3 Eyes, which act as commanders. They also start with many Shades, which are the basic grunt unit of the dark player.

==Eyes==
Eyes are large, slow units. They require a lot of light to blind, and are heavy (require many units to move when blinded). When all Eyes are blinded, the dark player loses.

==Shades==
Shades are small, faster than eyes, and extremely numerous. They can be blinded and manipulated easily.
