= To do =

==Fix broken stuff==
----
===Movement===
 * Units should go where they're ordered unless blocked by a unit that is currently executing an order
 * Less bounciness
 * Sort out force/mass/density stuff, so units move at reasonable speeds
 * Implement mousewheel focusing
 * Implement mousewheel turning

==Redo limited features==
----

===Level generator===
 * Should be more flexible
 * Obstacle generator should be able to generate different kinds of obstacles based on input parameters
    * takes: color, #sides, width, height, etc.
 * Obstacle placement should be procedural instead of pre-determined
 * Level generator should generate varied backgrounds, obstacle colors

===Manipulation===
 * Manipulation needs to be easy to do
 * Visually obvious
  * Tooltip?


==New things==
----
===AI===
 * Not actually a huge deal anymore. We will explore this once we fix unfun things.

===Larger maps, with scrolling===
 * This involves rewriting all the draw functions to deal with the relative position of the camera.

===Campaign?===
 * A series of levels introducing new tactics. 
 * Include tutorials.

===Multiplayer?===
 * Processing has libraries that would make this possible
