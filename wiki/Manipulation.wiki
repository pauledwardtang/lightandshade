#Pushing and pulling of blinded units

Manipulation is a central mechanic in this game. It is the pushing and pulling of other units.

All units can be manipulated when [Blinding blind], though the [Light_Player light] Light Source cannot be blinded.

Only two units can manipulate: Wisps and Shades. These units can manipulate any blind unit, friendly or not.
