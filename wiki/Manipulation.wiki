#Pushing and pulling of blinded units

Manipulation is a central mechanic in this game. It is the pushing and pulling of other units.

All units can be manipulated when [Blinding blind], though the [Light_Player light] Light Source cannot be blinded.

Only two units can manipulate: Wisps and Shades. These units can manipulate any blind unit, friendly or not.

When a unit is manipulated by another unit
 * Method 1 (For blinded units)
   # Spring is attach and everything will fall out of that
 * Method 2 
   # The manipulating unit "Hijack" the manipulated unit(drag it around)
 * Method 3
   # Use the physics engine and have the manipulating unit push the manipulated unit. This would require some AI work that will allow the unit to correct the push
